# ft_transcendence üéÆ

ft_transcendence is the **final project of the 42 common core**. 
The goal was to **recreate the classic Pong game**, one of the first video games ever created. 
My team and I built a **Single Page Application** (SPA) focused on real-time multiplayer gameplay and live chat, using modern web technologies to deliver a smooth, secure, and engaging experience.

This project allowed us to put into practice the skills and knowledge we gained throughout the common core, with a special emphasis on **security, efficient user management, and gameplay mechanics**.
